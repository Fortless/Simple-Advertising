#This is a kind of an info file, so read carefully!

The dev builds are not tested, don't have customisable messages and aren't stable. They are made to make you comfortable with the new changes
or just to see that I'm working on something. It isn't recommended to use these versions on your main server, because it may destroy your config,
your data file or your logs. If you want to use this, just put it on a test server. But apart from that, these builds have the most
features, API and bug fixes, so you'd have a good point wanting to use these, worst part being the new bugs appearing.

That said, go on, see what's new :3
